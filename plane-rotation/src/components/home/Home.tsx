                  Do you know the feeling, you are sitting at your desk and the
                  fear to be accidentally mistaken for a gang member slowly
                  starts to rise because you keep throwing gang signs trying to
                  visualise rotations of coordinate systems with your hands? Oh
                  boy, do I have a solution for you!

                  Not only does this app solve the perfectly rational fear of
                  being unintentionally shot as part of a durg cartell at work.
                  No, it even helps you visualise the effect of translations and
                  rotations in relation to fixed points in space.

                  The visualisation of rotations of the planes axes is fairly
                  straight forward. However, it becomes far more difficult to
                  envision the effect on the relation of a point somewhere on
                  the plane to another point in space. Thatâ€™s why I decided to
                  crew the plane with a plucky little squirrle trying to
                  navigate the dangerous skies full of vicious birds of prey.
                  All relations have the squirrels head looking straight ahead
                  as the center of their calculations.
