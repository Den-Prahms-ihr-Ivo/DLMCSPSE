\subsection{Objective}
The purpose of this application is to provide an intuitive as well as interactive tool to visualise transformations and their respective effect on the relation to fixed points in three-dimensional space. 

This tool is supposed to support the development of better test cases as well as aid students in the understanding of trigonometry. This tool is mainly aimed at software testers, as it helps them to get a more tangible vision of possible szenarios and now imaginable edge-cases. A secondary target group are (engineering-)students struggeling to get their head around trigonometry.

Since rotations in space become far more difficult to envision if we are concerned about an arbitrary point on the plane, and its relation to fixed points in space, instead of its center, this issue is being addressed by this application.

Although there are many other rotation visualisation tools out there, none of them visualize the relation to fixed points in space, let you move said points or the plane in space and donâ€™t address afroementioned issues.

\subsection{Requirements Refinement}
Previous rough user stories now get a clear testable statement assigned to them. 

Requirements that are tagged with \tcbox[colframe=TAGred, colback=TAGred]{\textbf{\footnotesize \acs{M2FR}}}, could not be implemented in time for the planned release and had to be moved to a future release. \newline Since these requirements are not essential for the core functionality and a timely release is ranked higher than the fulfillment of optional requirements, this was considered justified.

\subsection{Out of Scope}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Possibility for the user to enter a full transformation matrix by hand.}
\item \textbf{Adding a Trajectories} - via speed vectors in x,y and z direction. And calculating possible intersections/collisions.
\item \textbf{Mobile responsiveness} - mobile users aren't the target audience. Therefore the extra time can not be justified.
\item \textbf{A complete automated Frontend Test Suite} - currently I confined myself to manual tests after every major update to ensure correct functionality. This is feasible since the scope/functionality of this project is comparably small and the extra time can not be justified.
\item \textbf{Backwards compatibility with older browser}
\item \textbf{Assure correct rendering in more niche browsers}
\item \textbf{Undo/Redo functionality}
\item \textbf{Add a 2D (\enquote{Ship}-)Mode} - Still render everything in 3D but give the option to be limited to the ground and render the plane as a ship. In this case threats could come from above and below.
\item \textbf{Move and rotate Marble arbitrarily} - The point on the plane from which all measurements are calculated shall be freely positionable in relation to the plane.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Requirements that were moved to the next release.}

These requirements were not fulfillable in the set time frame and had to be moved to the next release since they are not vital for the intended functionality of the app.

\subsection{Documentation of Software \& System Architecture}

The basic architecture of this web-application follows the schematic sketched in Figure \ref{fig:flow_chart}.
The respective reducer, which is basically just a function, defines actions that atomic components can dispatch, for example \textcode{ROTATEPLANE} or \textcode{TRANSLATEPLANE}. This way, the reducer is the single place where updates for the, for instance, plane rotation logic have to be performed or new logic is to be added. The reducer returns the updated instance (either a transformed plane or an updated array of birds) which is then used to update the overarching context and further propagated to the corresponding components by react.

Atomic components are the parts of the web application that the user interacts with. They are either used to display information to the user, like in the \textcode{BirdCardComponent}, or to enable the user to input information into the system, like the \textcode{MathInputComponent}.

\subsection{Design and Implementation Procedure}
The design process was mostly defined by drawing and redefining new mock-ups that were refined after each sprint. The implementation of mathematical functions followed a \ac{TDD} procedure.

\subsection{Used 3rd Party Libraries}
The following 3rd party libraries were finally used in the making of this application.
\begin{itemize}
  \item React (\cite{React}), because of its simple design and vast ecosystem and the "ease" of state updates.
  \item React Router (\cite{ReactRouter}) as a well established way to navigate a website. 
  \item React Icons (\cite{ReactIcons}) as a nice and easy way to display common FontAwesome (\cite{FA}) Icons.
  \item Chakra-UI (\cite{chakra}), again for its ease of use and customizability of existing designs.
  \item PlotlyJS (\cite{PlotlyJS}), because it is the only graphing library I found that I could misuse for drawing shapes rather than the intended purpose of presenting data graphically. On top of it all it is well documented.
  \item Vite (\cite{Vite}) as a modern building tool, to get the app ready for production.
  \item Vitest (\cite{Vitest}), since I'm already using vite, the corresponding testing framework was the only logical choice.
  \item Docker (\cite{Docker}), which was not really necessary for my application in the end. But since the task asked for it, the webserver still runs as a dockerized container, running an NGINX \cite{NGINX} on the backend, serving the distribution version of this web application.
\end{itemize}
