\subsection{Test Plan}
Test Coverage for all functions that are involved in mathematical calculation shall have 100\% code coverage and shall cover edge cases. Functions and methods involved in mathematical calculations are listed under \enquote{\hyperref[tab:math_functions]{Mathematical Functions}}.

The user interface shall be tested according to the checklist listed under \enquote{\hyperref[tab:manual_tests]{Manual Tests}}. 

\subsection{Manual Tests}
A page reload shall be performed before each test case.
