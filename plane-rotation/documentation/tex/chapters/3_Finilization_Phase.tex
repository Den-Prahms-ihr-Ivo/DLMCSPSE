\subsection{Sprint Retrospective - Main Take-Aways}
Especially when working alone, complacency of procedure becomes a major issue and needs to get extra attention during future projects.

It is vital for future project plans and/or deadlines to be more realistic in terms of what is achievable in the given time/cost-frame.

\subsection{Methodologies and Tool}
You should especially reflect on the applied tools, methodologies, and techniques and on your handling of the resources

In future it maybe more sensible to switch to a backend centred application that utilises python and its vast ecosystem of well-tested mathematical function and not having to reimplement basic functionalities like matrix multiplication and therefore introducing unnecessary risk for error. Especially if the application is expected to grow and the calculations will get more complicated.
